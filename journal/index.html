                valuable layout is in all applications. An organized and useful layout allows our users to navigate
                comfortably and have positive associations with the brand. Important elements to remember when creating
                GUIs are sizing, placement, hierarchy, etc. To learn more about the best practices for modals, overlays, and dialog windows,
