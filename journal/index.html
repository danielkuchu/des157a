            <h2>Best Practices in Form Design</h2>
            <p>"An essential tip to enhance the usability of all graphic user interfaces is to minimize the amount of
                options for the user to worry about. As designers and developers, we allow our excitement of progress to
                cloud
                our empathy toward our users. The combination of clean organization and spacing allow the user to digest
                information at a standard rate, rather than being overwhelmed by too many options being available.To

                Despite my skepticism of capitalism, I think apple displays amazing organization on their website,
                utilizing open space and images to not overwhelm the user. Here is the <a

            <h2>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</h2>
            <p>"This article is super important for all web and app designers to read. I cannot stress enough how
                valuable layout is in all applications. An organized and useful layout allows our users to navigate
                comfortably and have positive associations with the brand. Important elements to remember when creating
                GUIs are sizing, placement, hierarchy, etc. To learn more about the best practices for modals, overlays,
                and dialog windows,
                feel free to click <a

            <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>
            <p>"To paraphrase a very popular saying, a picture is worth a thousand words. Implementing imagegry is
                essential to
                creating engaging and interesting multimodal projects, such as GUIs. Intruiging photographs are the key
                to getting
                more people to engage with one's content. When presented an article, just imaging, what do you look for
                first? Do your eyes
                go straight to the text-heavy content, or do they gloss over the main imagery of the page? To summarize
                my findings,
                I would suggest to all designers and developers to think about their's experience in any work that they
                do.

                This image is interesting because it provides an interactive element for the user. The textbox helps
                narrate the image so that the user can follow along with the scene. This relates to my topic because my
                topic is the first Pokemon games! The collection that I have speaks about me becasue this was a huge
                part of my childhood, playing games with my siblings and cousins.

            <h2>Game Design Research</h2>

            <p>
                I really enjoyed and learned from what this author had to say about physical comfort when
                interacting with a mobile or tablet application.
                This feature is often overlooked because designers are so focusesd on creating an attractive
                interface. This article just refreshes me on how
                human our design process is. I plan on applying this to my GameOn project paying attention to
                miniscule details that I may overlook that would greatly effect the overall experience
                of the user. This project excites me because I always wanted to design and build video games, but I
                never
                thought that I was smart enough to do it.
