    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>For my final project in Interactive Media II, I want to further develop my gameOn project because of my fascination with video game interfaces.</p>

</section>

<section id="info">

    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
    <p>The goal for my project is to add more complex interactions to my game. I want to add audio for many elements, specifically elements that have animations. Also, I would like to
        provide a selection of different characters for players to choose from. These different characters might also have different health points and different strengths on their attacks as well, 
        but that may be too complicated. Another thing that I want to do is generally improve the overall design composition of my pages. 

    </p>

    <h3>Design Strategies</h3>
    <p>For my design strategies, I plan on using Figma and pen+paper sketching to map out the look of my designs. This will allow me to edit my page completely to my liking, and doing this will allow
        the coding process to be much easier and focused. Another strategy I will be implementing is usabiity testing, which will allow me to see my designs from other perspectives. 
    </p>

    <h3>Interaction Strategies</h3>
    <p>Similarly, I want my users to have a captivating and fun experience, so I will be mapping out my interactions in Figma to see what works best and which UI looks best. Usability testing will be very
        important for my interaction designs, which is actually my priority for this project. 
    </p>

    <h3>Experience Goals</h3>
    <p>Overall, I want to do things that I fear within the world of frontend development. I want to do this because I want to be ready for my post-grad life and job-hunting process. If I could find a job where I could
        work with HTML, CSS, and JS, I would feel like all of my hard work that I put into this class would show in that environment.
